# Arthoor

social app for showcasing your beautiful artist portfolio

To run this project, you will need to follow the next steps.

1. Setup the repository
   - clone the repository on your local machine and make sure both projects exist and have all necessary files
   - use the cd command on both of them and run npm install to add all the dependencies and packages
   - make sure you have a postgres database available, either docker or anything else will suffice but make sure the connection details are the same or change them accordingly in the arthoor-server/src/app.module.ts file
   - run the database
   - use the respective run comands for both projects and watch for any problems in the terminal

  2. Use the app
     - after the setup was succesful you will have 2 projects running on http://localhost on 3000 port for frontend and 3333 for backend
     - register or login into the app
     - to add portfolios or images, the top-left corner will display a menu for you to do so
     - the menu will open a dialog where you can specify the details of your portfolios and images
     - you will first need to create a portfolio and then add images to it, otherwise the operations will not be succesful
     - browse the portfolios and images, upload your own and hide unimportant ones
    
  3. Have fun
